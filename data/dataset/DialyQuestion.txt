Carpet is held down with carpet nails . You just need to pull it hard and it will come up . Hello , is that the Peace Restaurant ?  Yes . I'd like a table for six at 7:00 this evening .

What are you doing now ?  Are you good at cooking ?  It is a good idea . What dish are you cooking now ? !  Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . Alright , tell me what you think about this one .  Yeah , maybe you're right . How about this outfit ?  No , I don't have any plans to go to a formal dance any time soon , but I love the way it looks . I just want to try it on ! What do you think about this ? It's casual , yet sophisticated .  How about this scarf , these earrings , and an anklet ? Won't you have some of this ?  It's my grandmother's favorite recipe for barbecue .  I use a special dressing and homemade catsup .  I'm glad you like it . Jim ? Jim ? ... What are you doing in the kitchen ?  Milk ? I thought you didn't like milk .  Nonsense . There's lots of food in the refrigerator ... What's behind your back ?  What are you hiding behind your back ? Let me see . Hello ?  Sorry , I think you have the wrong number .  Yes . Who are you looking for again ?  Oh , I thought you said Laura . Sorry about that . This is the right number , but Heather's not here right now . I saw your ad in The New York Times . I am seriously considering one of the apartments listed in it .  The two-bedroom apartment on 38th east street .  That's why I think it may suit my needs .  The ad says the rent would be 840 dollars per month . Is it true ? Mmm ... it is delicious .  Yes . It's superb .  In fact , could I ask you for the recipe ?  Yes , I've got it . Hello , who's that speaking ?  Yes , I do .  Yes , it's fully furnished .  15,000 Yuan , including water , but electricity and gas . I'd like to buy one of these refrigerators . Do I have to pay in cash ?  Fine .

Is it good ?  I think I'll try it , and give me some green salad together . I'd like to buy a house about 300m with a garden . Can you help me ?  Where is it ?  How many rooms are there ?  How much is it ? Hi Sam .  When did you buy your new computer ?  So what's the problem ?  Can I have a look ? Are you ready to order now , sir ?  Would you like an appetizer ?

Well , it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish .  Then , how about this one ? Let's see . I had the salmon starter which was £ 5.90 and my Pizza was £ 8.25 .  So that's £ 14.15 for me and £ 16.50 for you .  Yes , so that's an extra £ 6 for both of us .  And I had a dessert - that's another £ 3.50 . And you had coffee which is £ 2 . Good evening .  Let me check the list . Yes , we do have a reservation under Mr . Tim .  It doesn't matter . Follow me , please . What do you think of the table in the center of the dining room ?  I'm sorry , but you see , all the tables by the window are small , with up to 4 seats . I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking .  I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house .  Not necessary . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive .  Realtors always get a commission .

You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains . That will probably be pretty expensive too . Having good curtains made isn't cheap .  Absolutely not . The windows must be measured , and then the curtains need to be made professionally . So that will take a while . Maybe a month or so .

The special today is steak . Bob , look at this sentence . ' Healthy eating is not about strict nutrition philosophies , staying unrealistically thin , or depriving yourself of foods you love .

So we are free to have whatever foods we love . It is unbelievable .  Seriously ? A table for two , please .  Thank you . It's fine .  What do you recommend ? We'd like some of your local specialities .  One cream of fish soup and two portions of prawns . Good evening , Mr . Frank . Bourbon on the rocks ?  What about Mao Tai , one of the most famous liquors in China ? It's good indeed . It never goes to the head .  Some do , some don't . Many people in the North are fond of liquors .

What would you like to have for your appetizer , sir ?  And what would you like to have for the main course  Apple , banana and strawberry pie .

The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .  It wasn't just once .

Can I have the receipt ? Just in case I can trace it if something goes wrong . It's a beautiful day ! Let's play on those rides in the park .  Me too . I love to play on the swing as well . Swing is my favorite .  Look at the flowers over there . What are they ?  They are . We can find many different kinds of flowers and insects in the park . I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything . Can you help me find a few things ?  My laptop , do you see it ?  Where's my book ?  The dictionary . Let's go to Burger Queen for lunch . They have good cheese burgers .  Look at the long line , there are always a lot of people waiting in lines just for the cheese burger . It must be very delicious .  Come on . It is worth waiting . Their cheese burgers are really popular . Once you have it , you will love it .  Yup , they have good French fries as well . Not very thick , but crispy enough .

To what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ?  But you look quite proficient in using them now .  Yes , table etiquette .

Yikes ! What was that noise ?  Did you have to blow right next to the phone ?  Of course I heard that . I thought a plane had crashed into your house .  I will blow my nose sometime for you , and you'll see . I called HP about my computer .  They said I need a new hard drive .  It's not too much , only about $ 85 .  No , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . I'm going to take a nap .  That's a good idea .  No , thanks . Just let me sleep until I wake up .  Okay . I think I'll be awake by then .

Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?  Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .  That's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .  Yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . Do you think chinese families have changed much in the last 50 years ?  What do you think is the biggest change ?  That's true .

What's the series about ?  It sounds interesting , but I am not a big fan of TV shows . They're time consuming and don't have much depth . Have you ever tried shopping online ?  That's right . Seeing is believing .  That happens . Without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e-shop may suddenly disappear .  It's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . Paying online is much safer than before , but I still have the feeling that it's not safe enough . Did you watch the finale last night ? My favorite singer won !  Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .  Me too .  Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV ?  Yeah , and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind . Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society .  But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days . There's no such program on this year .  No surprise . The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences ' appetite .

We put $ 500 into the savings account , and $ 750 into our stock account . It ’ s so great to be here ! I ’ m so excited to help you and my daughter with your new home !  That ’ d be great , but could I have a cup of tea first ?  That would be lovely , thanks .  I ’ ll take a little milk , but no sugar , please .

Can you set the oven to 200 degrees Celsius ? Excuse me , do you go to the Central Park ?  Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park ?  ( A few minutes later . ) Should I get off at the next stop ?  Is it a long ride ? Are you still coming to my place for dinner tomorrow night ?  Yes , I was just wondering how you and your roommate were planning on coming to my place .  That's what I thought you would do . Listen , I live in a bit of a rough neighborhood . It's just down the street from all the bars . You probably don't want to be walking around after dark .  I wish it wasn't , but there is actually a lot of crime and prostitution around here . Julia , Julia , Julia . My daring Julia , what's wrong with you ?  Yes , I have called you three times . What makes you in a daze ?  Did someone get hurt ?  What a terrible accident ! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident ? It's such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping .  I know . But we could get some exercise in , and we could get some errands run , too . Window-shopping won ’ t cost you anything .  Well , we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper , go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner , and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor .  Fine , we'll do that on the way home , so we don ’ t have to carry it the whole time . What do you think about this store ? I heard it ’ s a posh store that ’ s only got branches in big cities .

I think it would really suit you . Steven , you are always looking in good shape . How do you keep it ?  Yeah , you are right . Tell me your normal diet .  And ?  Oh , no wonder you are healthy . How is your house hunting going ?  How much are you looking to spend ?  Looks like you ’ re not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that .  Well , if you want to live in London , you have to pay the price ! What's your apartment like ?  What is it like living in on-campus housing ?  Did you have to pay a deposit ?  Do you have to pay utilities on top of your monthly rent ? Have you moved into your new house yet , Michael ?  So , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ?  How old is the house then ?  Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ? Oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people .  Yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?  When you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .  Make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . Hey Ayden , I was wondering if you could do me a favor .  It's kind of a big favor . I'm absolutely flat broke , and I owe my landlady $ 200 . she's given me until Friday to give it to her , but I don't get paid until next Monday . Do you think you could loan me some cash until I get paid ?  If you can't give me the full amount , a fraction of it would still help . I'll pay you back on Monday . I promise .  Thanks a lot Ayden .

Yes , it's good for her but not for me . You see , she tells me that I'll feel better about myself if I slim down .

It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look .  See that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that .  You are right . But what if the avalanche happened ? Can I help you , sir ?  What kind of presents do you want ?  OK . How about some very cool sneakers for your children ? Anyway , it won't cost you much . It's only around $ 59.95 for each pair . It might be cheaper than that in America .  Just a hunch , sir . I love breathing fresh air in the suburb places , while sitting in the morning sunshine .  Yeah , just return to nature and feel the thrills of its beauty .  Sure . The sunny days of spring are ideal for outdoor gatherings .  OK , you go back to our car and fetch the picnic stuff .

Dad told me you brought him here when he was young , too . Now , it's my turn .  I'd like to eat a hamburger and a bottle of coca-cola .  Then there is nothing particular I'd like to eat . Grandpa , what's your favorite here ? Sis , why did you ask me to come to this bargain market ? It's so crowded , and you can't find anything that you really want .  Are you serious ? How can that be ?  Come on . You know , you can never really win . The salesperson never loses . They make their living out of it .  Oh , this silk carpet is really beautiful . Look at the pattern , and how delicate it is ! Hey , Terry , have all the players got here ?  OK . By the way , the stadium is terrific .  We are lucky to play in a new stadium .  Look out .

It is about 15 kilometers to get there .  How much will it cost in that case ?  Your charge is divided into two parts , the Payment in Advance and the rest . I thought that I should pay all of it before moving . That was really a nightmare !  I was stuck between 15th and 16th floors in the elevator .  I pressed the emergency button ! And then I stayed in the elevator waiting for the rescue .  A little bit , but I know that the elevator isn't enclosed . at least I wouldn't be smothered there . Hi , my name is Ted , what's yours ?  I said , I'm Ted , who are you ?  Do you come here often , Laura ?  Let's go outside and talk . So Laura , do you come here often ? Come in and have some coffee , Anna . The kids have just gone out to the mall to hang out with their friends .  They spend hours there , especially on weekends .  I know several .

By the way , I don ’ t want a pet that could be dangerous , like a tarantula or rattlesnake .  That sounds ideal . Could you show me some ? I think I should join a fitness centre . I am getting a little fat and I'm totally out of shape . Even a quick walk of a few hundred metres leaves me out of breath .  I guess you're right .

We also eat a lot of vegetables in my country , buy we eat different kinds .  We eat a lot of sweet corn , broccoli and eggplant .  Why is it relatively expensive ? Can you give me a hand with some things in the kitchen ? I don ’ t think I can finish everything in time .  First of all , I need you to do the drying up . I ’ m almost finished the washing up . I ’ m going to clean the cooker when I finish .  We ’ ll have this finished in no time with two if us working on it .  Actually , it was just some leftovers from yesterday . I made far too much food to eat alone . I am glad you could come over to help me finish it . Have you seen Bill recently ?  Daisy ’ s in hospital too . She god food poisoning last week .

Oh , what ’ s she like ?  Is she old or young ?  Is she strict ? Waiter , bring me the menu , will you ?  I'd like to see the menu . Would you get me one , please ?  Thank you . Ah ! But this is in French . Would you mind giving me the English menu ?  Thanks . I'll need a while to choose . Could you come back in a minute ? Mike ! Look at the floor !  What's wrong with it ? It's filthy !  It's filthy because you never wipe your shoes .  What are you looking for now ? Would you like to come by and play bridge ?  Well , to tell the truth , I don't really feel like it tonight . I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired .  Oh , we always go to the movies . Can't we do something different ?  Let's see . How do you feel about playing bridge ? So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ?  That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too .

Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a little ?  I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?

Well , this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand . First of all , what is this FICA , and SUI Y tax , and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan ?  Then here we have a series of deductions . First off are the federal ones . FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act , or something like that . It's your federal income tax . And then there's Social Security and Medicare , which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work .  That's right . Below the federal deductions are the state deductions . There's the state income tax , and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up , but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take .

Are you doing anything tonight , Mary ?  But that is terrible ! I am only here for one night ! My Goodness ! What a busy line so early in the morning ! Hello .  Hi , Basil .  Yes , by all means . I was just about to leave .  I'll wait on the sidewalk . It's very kind of you . Listen , Karen , I need your help . I don't know anyone here yet .  My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L.A.Hank and I will be flying there tonight .  Doctors aren't sure yet.But the real problem is Suzy . She has a bad cold , and we don't want to take her with us . But we don't know who can stay with her .  Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . This sucks . I hate buying lingerie . Okay , just find something and get out of here . Alright , these are fine . Oh , no , don ’ t come over here , don ’ t come over here .  Um , I ’ m just having a look around . It ’ s my girlfriend ’ s birthday tomorrow . I'm trying to find her something .  Sure that ’ s fine.This is so awkward ... what ones do I pick ? What size is she ?  Just pick something and get the hell out of here.Um , I'll go with these two.This is mortifying . I just want to get this over with.She better thank me for this ... Welcome to Al ’ s Garage . What seems to be the problem ?  Very wise decision . When was the last time you had a tune up ?  We usually recommend that you bring your car in every five thousand kilometers .  First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . what do we need to get from the supermarket ?  a crate of beer ? Why do we need that ?  we can buy a three-liter bottle . It works out cheaper per liter . We should buy a packet of butter and a few pints of milk too .  I think we should get half a kilo of minced beef and a few pork chops . have you bought a present for jim ’ s birthday yet ?  I ’ m having the same problem . I want to get something really special . Jim always seem to know exactly what to get people as gifts .  he bought me an iron .  maybe not , but my iron was getting old . In fact , it stopped working the week after jim bought me the new one . It ’ s as if he knew that my old iron would soon stop working ! pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?  thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?  well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .  yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . my lease ends next month , so I have to find a new place .  Do you know any places ?  thank you . I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet .  I can only afford about 1,000 yuan a month . that was a really good meal , Gordon .  well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .  let's see how much the bill is .  what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill . oh , Sam ! Is this your dog ?  Cindy , you're so cute .  I have a little white cat .  yes , cats are always gentle . and they don't need a lot of space since they're small . oh , the clothes here are so expensive ! No wonder there are few people .  yeah , it's lovely , but to be frank , it's not the most practical . You don't have many formal events in your calendar , do you ?  when you buy clothes , you must think about the material , quality and price .  make sure you buy what you need and your clothes can be worn for various occasions . can I get you something to drink ?  so how about an aperitif ?  stirred or shaken ?  here you are . my mp3 player is broken , so I want to change it for an mp4 player . Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy ?  Oh , that's a good idea . Perhaps I should have a try .  that's cool . I can use the computer and the internet pretty well , but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products .  yeah , if I buy a cell phone like this , I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go , and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4 . Hi , Sam . I want to buy a pet . Do you have any ideas ?  why ? anything special there ?  Oh , really ? are there any snakes ?  that's terrific . I can't wait to check it out . There isn't much rice , is there ?  Are there any potatoes ?  I'm very hungry , Donald . What can I eat ?  But I want some rice and some meat . your mp3 looks so cool . Where did you get it ?  really ? Do you often shop online ?  I've never tried E-shopping . Is it better than shopping at an actual store ?  sounds good , and I don't have to queue up at the cashier . OK darling , got some pizzas , potato chips , hot dogs and lots of cheese !  Humph ! Right , so what did you get ?  Organic ? What ’ s organic ? Do we need organic carrots ... ?  Oh , so organic vegetables are the green option , right ? Hello , could I speak to Allison , please ?  When do you expect him back ?  Well , may I leave a message ?  Would you please ask him to call Chris when he gets back ? Anything else I can do for you ?  OK , here you are.Anything else ?  You can buy a money order and mail mature immigration .

That's true , but I love the living room , it's huge and filled with sunshine .  It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park . This apartment is wonderful .  How much would I have to pay for rent ?  That ’ s way too much money .  How about if I pay $ 850 ? Do you like cooking ?

Yes , it would be nice to see the apartment .  Yes , I can be there at 6 . This house is not looking all that great from here  I don ’ t think that it is looking any better inside here .  It is just too dark in here with so few windows .  The kitchen may be large , but it doesn ’ t have any storage space . Oh , I am not sure I even want to look at this house !  It doesn ’ t look much better inside this place .  There are hardly any windows in here , and that makes it really gloomy .  Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper . Hi , can I speak with the apartment manager , please ?  I'm calling about the apartment for rent on Main Street .  I would love to see it .  Yes , I will be able to make it then .

Can I require the owners to fix the problems ? What would be the earliest that I could actually move into my new house ?  What should we do to make sure that we have the electricity and water turned on ?  There are a few things that we want to do to the place , like painting and carpet cleaning .  I asked the store to deliver my new appliances on the day we are moving in . Can you tell me the results of my home inspection ?  I never had a home inspection before .  I asked the owners , and they said that everything was great with the house .  I heard that the owners must fix all of the problems before the escrow closes . What would be a good day to finally move into the house ?  Will the electricity and water be on , or do we need to do something to get it turned on ?  The carpet needs to be cleaned , and I want to paint the walls a different color .  I want my appliances to be delivered as we are moving into the house .

I also bought a new dressing table and a new bedside table .  do you think that I should get a new wardrobe ?  yes . I have so many clothes stuffed into it . Perhaps I should get rid of some of them . There are clothes in there that I never wear anymore . What do we need for the barbecue ?  I can ’ t wait to start cooking . I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal.Do you have enough plates and utensils ?  And if people drop them , they won ’ t break.We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .

I ’ ll just unplug it and take a look inside the machine ... oh , yes . There ’ s the problem . It ’ s quite simple . I ’ ll sort it out in a few minutes . Hi , you said that you might need some help with preparing dinner.What would you like me to do ?  Ok , I ’ ll peel the vegetables and you chop them . I ’ m terrible at chopping vegetables .

Yes , we don ’ t want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons.of water.Ok , I ’ m really to do the meat.Should I cook it over a low flame ? What would you like for dessert ?

They ’ re pretty satisfied with it . it ’ s such a nice day outside . Let ’ s take a walk into town and do some window-shopping .  I know .

Did you already take the history exam ?  I take it tomorrow morning . There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ?  What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ?  Hopefully he will use the same exam , cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . Han Maimed , What's your plan for the weekend ?  I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays .  Come on , Han Maimed , don ’ t make a fuss . A lot of Americans , including many scientists , believe in religion .  Yes , they are compatible . Actually , the U .

But attending Miss Li's class is just waste of time . No more than one third of her students will go to her class .  Yeah , my boyfriend plays the video game every time in class with me .

It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing .  Yes , I am . I am from Taiwan . I came here to study political science .  I like it so far . But my English still needs work . Oh ... I am really worried about the exam . I have no idea what will be on it .  Yes , but my notes are all nonsense . I can't figure out what is important .  Yes .  What do you mean ? You think I don't write enough . Can I help you ?  Are you a professor ?  Yes , I am kidding.But don't you know only professors and students with disabilitiescan apply for parking permits ?

I tried that.They don't have anything now . So what can I do ?  I know that . You don't have to tell me that . That's my problem . I know I have the right to work for the university . That's legal.But they don't have a job for me . And it's illegal for me to get a job elsewhere . Excuse me . Do you have a minute ? I'd like to tell you about the Bucky Card .  Do you know about the Bucky Card ?  The Bucky Card is a great way for you to save money while you have a good time here at school.It gives you discounts on all kinds of things . Movies , pizza , clothing , school supplies .  The Card doesn't actually give you discounts on beer.But it will give you discounts on certain club cover charges.So if you want to see your favorite band at Amy's or Cosmo's Club , you get a discount on the entrance fee .

The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes .  Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago . She said I just had to pay a late fee .  She said I couldn ’ t until I had my birth certificate . Here it is . Hello .  What's up ?  I don't know .  No , Lucy . Don't get me wrong .

Yes , I want to know about the Normandy Landing .  Oh , wow ! There are lot of sites . Hey , Jordan , is that you ? Long time no see !  Yeah , I think so ! I pledged Phi Iota Alpha , so I'm living at the frat house now .  Yeah , yeah , I know , it's totally cliche , but really , I think it's been a good decision . I've got a lot of support and good suggestions from the guys . What about you ? What have you been up to ?  That sounds smart ... but kind of boring . Wow ! Look at all these books ! I bet I can find a book about anything here !  Ok , I'm sorry . Are you the librarian ? Maybe you can help me , I am looking for a book .  I am looking for a book that has nursery rhymes .

I do want to take some additional credits this year to get a minor in psychology .  Yeah . Here ’ s my list . I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . How should we commemorate the centenary of the founding of the university ? We have been given quite a large budget to pay for some events .  Do you think that we should invite alumni and former professors ?  Good idea . We should also hold a series of presentations . We could have presentations on the history of the university , the courses we offer , and our links with other universities .  We could have another on the successes of graduates from here . Hey Eve , how are you ?  I ’ m ok . I ’ m so busy !  Yes . Don ’ t you ?  Which class are you working on right now ? Lucy , you ’ re back . How was your first day of school ?  What classes did you have ?  What do you think about the teachers ?  That ’ s too bad . How was your English teacher ? Who was the best teacher that you ever had ?  What was she like ?  What kind of things did you learn ?  Anything ? Do you really believe that we can do anything ? Who's that over here ?  What do you think of the teacher ?  What does she teach ?  Is she your teacher ? In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon .  Actually , five and a half . On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning .  That's too much for us really .  I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . Ms.Green , are the schools more or less similar everywhere throughout the United States , or do they differ in various sections ?  Do most students in the United States attend private schools or public schools ?  Which students go to private schools , then ?  But are the public schools good everywhere ? Do you offer a course in business management ?  How many nights a week is it ?  And how long does the course last ?  When does it start ? Hey , This is your order .  Yes . I started this part-time job just three days ago . And my internship will last 1 week . I'm still a student now .  Of course not . You know , there are many foreign customers like you here . And I think it's good for me to improve my oral English .  No , I'm not an English student . But I do like English . I'm going to be a volunteer in the 2008 Olympics where I want to be helpful with the language . So I try to improve my English . Can I help you ?  Do you have your syllabus with you ? May I see it ?  Let me see . Oh yes . Your professor has placed this book on reserve . That means you cannot find it on the shelves in its usual place . You need to go to a special room called the reserve room . It's down the hall and to the right .  You see , your professor wants every one in the class to read the chapter . If one student removes the book from the library , it is likely that none of the other students will have the opportunity to read it . So , your professor has insured that all students have the opportunity to read it by placing it on reserve . I've been thinking of taking I've been thinking of taking a Crazy English course.Do you think it's a good idea  Really ? Do you think English is that important ?  Great ! It's always better to do things with a friend .  No , I left it at home.Sorry ! Can I help you ?  Yes , but it's checked out .  It's popular you know . You want to reserve it ?  Fill out this form and we will send you a note when we get the book . What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school ?  I don't know . I failed my exam .  A B plus .  But I should have aced it . I mean I finished the paper so quickly , thinking it's a piece of cake . But when I knew my result , I was like what ? That can't be true ! This is my admission card , and these are the books .  By the way , can I renew the borrowing ?  Sense and Sensibility , English version .  Can I just do it here ? Have we handed out all the water ?  Nothing . The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later .  Terrific . There is one girl said , It is the best game I've ever watched .  Clive was really outstanding . Not only he put on a big show himself , but also he inspired the whole team . There are lots of new teachers in our class this semester .  To be honest , I like all of them , except for the math teacher . Though he must be quite young , he seems like an old person . He's so boring .  It might be the English teacher . What about you ?  She is a pretty good teacher ! With her help I think I can make great progress in English . I've been so stressed these days .  I don't know where to go for college , and what to major in .  And I also want to get scholarships to help me pay for the tuition . I want to get the burden off my family .  OK , OK . I'm so sorry .

How about going to the cinema ?  That's good ! I've also heard there will be a party held by the Students ' Union tomorrow evening . Would you like to go with me tomorrow night ?  Why ?

Could you please help me to check out the book ?  I can't remember that clearly . It probably be Charles ...  No , no , no . I'm not interested in literature .  Oh , sorry . I'm always absent-minded . I remember that I've put a note in my pocket . Do you offer a course in business management ?  How many nights a week is it ?  And how long does the course last ?  When does it start ? At what age do children start school in your country ?  Do boys and girls go to school together ?  Do you think this is a good idea ?  Do some children go on to university ? Good morning , Miss .  Yes , I'd like to know how to use the library . You know , I'm a new student here .  Yes.Here ' s my identification .  Thank you very much . By the way , how many books am I allowed to check out ? Who's that over here ?  What do you think of the teacher ?  What does she teach ?  Is she your teacher ? In my country , we go to school from 8 o'clock in the morning until five in the afternoon .  Actually , five and a half.On Saturday , we have classes only in the morning .  That's too much for us really .  I'm going to try to find out where the school is located . Our maths teacher is rather humorous .  No , not at all.His examples are really interesting .  Yeah , how about your maths teacher ?  Bad luck , Anne . what do you hope to do when you finish university ?  after I graduate , I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer . I think I ’ Ve got a good chance of passing . There ’ s a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London , provide  if life were easy , then we ’ d achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored .  that ’ s why ambition need to be realistic . You can ’ t achieve something that ’ s totally unrealistic . How are you doing today ?  What may I do for you ?  What do you need help with ?  Have you looked in the periodicals ? That looks like an interesting book .  There are the pyramids . It ’ s easy to see how they got that name ! they don ’ t have smooth sides though .  Look at that cylindrical office building . I ’ Ve never been seen one that shape before .  TV towers are usually thicker at the bottom than at the top . They ’ re not perfectly cylindrical . What can I do for you ?  I need your library card .  It seems you have late fees .  Yes , I ’ m sure . How may I help you ?  Do you have your library card ?  It appears that you have late fees .  Yes , really . What do you need ?  I ’ m going to need your library card .  Why don ’ t you apply for one right now ?  Please fill out this application . What can I do for you ?  You can apply for one here .  If you like , you can apply right now .  I ’ m going to need you to complete this application . Can you tell me where I can park ?  I drive an automobile .  Yes , I have seen those spots .  I park in the evenings . Good morning . Is this where I can get a library card issued to me ?  I'm done .  Sure , here it is .  I am pretty sure how to use it , but can you remind me ? Professor , I will not be here for our next class meeting .  I tried to work something out , but I really do have to miss one class .  I'm going to be doing a lot of extra reading .  Yes , I remember . Excuse me , Professor . I am going to miss next week's class .  No , I have to do this ; it's important !  I've made arrangements with a friend to help me .  Yes , I know . I would like to register for a class today .  I would very much enjoy taking a Psychology class.Because I'm crazy .  Which days are these classes on ?  What about the other class ? Can you tell me what the date and time of our field trip is ?  Yes , I can write that on my calendar .  Yes , I understand .  No , I don't have a ride yet . Hello , I need to register for a class .  I want to take a Psychology class .  Can you tell me what days the classes are on ?  And the other class ? Could you help me to register for a class ?  Are there any Psychology classes available ?  On what days are the classes ?  Can you tell me about the other class ? Could you help me ?  I can't seem to find my class .  It's in the C building .  Do you think you can tell me where it is ? I have a real problem when I meet people .  I never know when to shake hands and when not to . Can you tell me something about it ?  Oh yes . Men , women , and children shake hands all the time .  But some women do shake hands . And now a lot of children have such good manners , they shake hands too . What do you think is harder , reading or writing ?  I don ’ t think I understand what you mean . Could you explain a little more ?  Oh , now I see what you mean . When you ’ re reading , you are just looking , but when you are writing , you are actually doing something !  I think I see what you mean . I can read Shakespeare but I definitely can ’ t write it . Are you ok , Chuck ? You look pale .  Oh , poor you . You know what ? I found a new way to learn Chinese and it works very well .  Sure . I'm learning Chinese through songs .  You can say that . I can actually sing some of them now . How's your time spent in the United States ?  I'm glad to hear that . What impressed you most ?  You mean we Chinese think differently from the Americans ?  That's weird . Matthew , do you know much about body language in countries around the world ?  Well , I had a meeting today with a woman from Japan and she wouldn't stop bowing ! I didn't know what to do !  No , I tried to shake her hand , but her hand was so limp I was a bit offended .  But she was in America ! Shouldn't she have known that strong handshakes in America signify confidence and respect ? Have you adapted to the lifestyle in China ?  What ?  What is it ?  That makes you feel uncomfortable ? Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ?  Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ?  Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies .  Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . What were you and Richard talking about earlier ? It looked intense .  Oh , no . I know how insensitive he can be . What has he done now ?  But , you were born and raised in California !  What a racist ! How can you stand working with the guy ? You know , I really don ’ t think Americans are very romantic .  That ’ s the impression I get from the movies , and from looking around . Men and women seem very business-like in their relations with each other .  Is it true or isn ’ t it ?  I just think you ’ re trying to change the subject . But go ahead . Eric , how long will you be in China ?  Well , have you ever thought about learning some Chinese ?  Don't worry . All things are difficult before they are easy .  Well , are you invested in some language-exchange program ? Are you studying any languages here ?  What are you majoring in ?  Is it difficult to learn ?  Do you know anything about Britain and America ? Excuse me , I need your assistance .  I have no idea where my class is .  My class is in the C building .  Do you mind telling me where it is ? Do you mind helping me ?  I'm not sure how to find my next class .  The C building , I think .  Could you point me in that direction ? How do I buy my textbooks ?  Yes , I have my list .  Yes , I know where the bookstore is .  No , I didn't know I could do that . Where can I buy textbooks ?  Yes , I have that .  No , I don't know where the bookstore is .  Really ? How can I do that ? Do you have the notes from last week's class ?  I couldn't make it .  I was sick .  Are these all of them ? When are we leaving for our field trip ?  Yes , I will write that down .  Yes , I will be there on time .  Yes , someone is coming to get me . Can you help me buy my textbooks ?  No , I don't have that .  I am not sure where the bookstore is .  Yes , I knew I could do that . Exactly how do I go about selling them ? Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine ?  I want to buy that candy .  Yeah , so far , so good .  Yeah , I already knew that . I've never seen a machine like this before and need some help .  I want to buy a drink .  I've got the correct change already .  OK , what next ? I need to find somewhere to park .  I need to find a space on campus .  Where is the parking structure at ?  Do you know if the parking structure is full or not ? I was wondering if you could help me to get a library card .  I'm finished .  OK , the form is all filled out .  No , I have no idea what they are . I want to know how to buy something from this machine .  I want to buy one of those snack things .  I'm clear so far .  It won't go in ! I really need to find a parking spot .  Do you know any spaces on campus ?  Where is it located ?  Do you have any idea if the parking structure has any spaces left ? Excuse me . I am interested in getting a library card .  OK , here it is .  Here's my license and form .  Yes , I know what to do . Do you know where I can park ?  I want a space on campus .  Where can I find it ?  Is it full ? How may I help you ?  Is that all you need ?  Anything else ?  I need your library card . What can I do for you ?  What ’ s the problem ?  Have you checked the computer ?  What did it say ? What can I do for you today ?  Can I do anything else for you ?  We don ’ t allow people to check out magazines .  It ’ s just a policy of ours . May I help you ?  May I do anything else for you ?  Will that be all ?  Do you have your library card ? What can I do for you today ?  Can I do anything else for you ?  Is that all ?  May I see your library card , please ? How may I help you ?  Is that all you need ?  You ’ re not allowed to do that .  It ’ s our policy . What can I do for you today ?  Can I do anything else for you ?  Is that all ?  May I see your library card ? Do you mind if I borrow the notes from last week ?  I was unable to make it .  I was sick that day , and couldn't make it .  Are there any more ? Let me get last week's notes .  I couldn't come .  I wasn't feeling well .  Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes ? Excuse me , Professor . I have to talk to you about why my homework didn't get done .  I had to watch a football game instead .  Yes , I think so .  I'll make it up next week . Could you tell me if you have ever taken a class from Dr . Miller ?  Yes , but I have never taken his class before .  Yes , that's what I need .  Yes , I guess so . Excuse me , Professor , is there a time when I could meet with you ?  I would like to come in at three o'clock .  Yes , I can .  I got it . I don't have my homework today .  I was really sick .  Yes , I probably could .  Next class meeting . Let me tell you what happened to my homework .  Actually , I did it , but then it got lost .  Yes , I could .  I'll make it up early next week . I have to miss school next week .  Unfortunately , this is what I have to do .  I've got it all covered .  Don't worry , this will be the last class I miss . Do you know anything about Dr . Miller's classes ?  I'm thinking of taking his class next semester .  Yes , I really need someone who is really good .  Maybe , but I'm not sure . Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr . Miller's classes ?  I'm thinking about taking his class next semester .  I'm not sure because I really need to learn something , but I also worry about grades .  I really need to learn this stuff . Professor , could I make an appointment with you ?  Two o'clock would be the best time .  No , I'm not sure .  I see . Professor , can you help me add your class ?  No , I will have to get an add sheet .  No , I don't know where that is .  I think I can find it . Professor , I am going to need to leave class early today .  I need to go to the airport to pick up a relative .  Yes , I've got that part covered .  I don't need to leave until the very end of class . I am unsure how to add a class and need help .  Yes , I have an add sheet .  No , I'm not sure .  Thanks . I understand what to do now . What date will our field trip be on ?  Yes , I will make note of that .  I will be there half an hour early .  Yes , someone is picking me up . Excuse me , Professor , I have a problem and need to leave class early .  I am not feeling well .  Yes , it's all taken care of .  I can stay a few more minutes . I am not sure how to add a class .  I'll bring one next time .  I think I know where it is .  Thank you for your directions . It's clear . Where should I park ?  I drive a scooter  No , I haven't seen those spots .  I park in the daytime . I am sorry , but I can't stay until the end of class .  I have an appointment .  No , but I'll make sure someone helps me out this week with my missed work .  I am leaving right now . What is the best place to park ?  I drive a motorcycle .  I am not sure what a handicapped spot is .  I park days and evenings . I'd like to purchase a parking permit for next semester .  I am a daytime student .  I will be driving my car .  I'll pay for it with a check . I have an appointment for half past one .  Well , I have a problem with my class schedule .  It seems that I've been given two classes scheduled at the same time .  Is there any way that you can fix my schedule ? I'll need a parking permit for next semester .  I only attend class part-time in the evenings .  I have both , but I usually use my car to get to school .  I'll pay cash . I want to buy a parking permit , please .  I attend both day and evening classes .  I ride a motorcycle .  I'll use a credit card , thank you . I'm here for my appointment .  I have an issue with my schedule .  I have two classes on here that are at the same time .  Can you change that for me ? Professor , do you have a few moments when I could meet with you ?  Three would be a good time .  I'm not sure .  OK , I'll find it . I was supposed to meet with you at half past one .  There's a problem with my schedule .  Two of my classes occur at the same time .  Is it at all possible for you to fix that error ? Excuse me , Professor . I think there might be an error in my test score .  I think that the percentage is incorrect .  Sure , let's do it .  I don't see any mistakes . I was looking at my test score and think that it should be higher .  I think an answer got marked wrong that should have been marked right .  That would be great !  This one right here should be right . Could we go over some things , because I think my test score is wrong .  Both .  Yeah , I'm ready .  These look strange . I was wondering how you are going to calculate our final grades .  What counts the most ?  Do you grade on a curve or use percentages ?  What if we miss something ? What do you base our grades on ?  Does the final count the most ?  How do you total our scores ?  What if we are out sick ? I'd like to talk to you about my grades .  I am worried that I messed up on a test .  I think I am doing great , except for that one test !  I think that I could study a little harder for tests . What can I help you with today ?  Do you have your library card ?  Would you like to apply for one right now ?  I ’ m going to need you to fill out the application . How do you decide what grade we get ?  What is the most important factor ?  How can we keep track of our grades ?  What if we can't get to school ? Professor , I'm concerned about my grades . Do you have a minute ?  I want to know if I am doing OK .  I am afraid that I might not be doing all that well .  I think I could take better notes and read a little more . Could you talk to me for a few minutes about my grades ?  Am I failing ?  I am pretty sure that I am in trouble .  I missed a few classes ; I need to make sure I come to school on a regular basis . May I help you ?  Let me see your library card .

I ’ m not sure if the class schedule will allow me to take all of them though . What ’ s up ? You don ’ t look too good .  I liked physics . It ’ s all math , really . arcs , curves , velocity , cool stuff .  A physics class about the creation of the universe ? That ’ s some pretty unscientific language there . Sounds more religious to me .  Turtles ? Whatever ... Look , all that ’ s required for the creation of matter an imbalance of particles and anti-particles . At least , that ’ s what the math says . Alright everyone settle down . Let ’ s get started.As you know , an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system . It is not enough to simply memorize our laws , it is necessary that we comprehend why and how they were formed . This brings me to our topic for today . Does anyone know what we celebrate on May first ?  No , that ’ s May fifth in Spanish , James , no wonder you are failing my Spanish class . No , May first is International Workers ’ Day .  No ! It is not considered to be a national holiday here in the US , but in other countries it is .  In the nineteenth century , working conditions were appalling , with workers being forced to work ten , twelve , and fourteen hours a day . Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly , despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders , and by April 1886 , 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed , so labor organizers took drastic measures . They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work . And , on May First 1886 , the resolution took effect . Hello everyone , and welcome to our CPR for beginners course.First of all , does anyone know what CPR stands for ?  That ’ s right ! We apply CPR in the case of cardiac arrest or pulmonary arrest .  Well , basically if your heart stops pumping blood , or your lungs stop pumping air , then we need to get them going again ! That ’ s when we have to apply this procedure . Let ’ s begin ! I need a volunteer .  Alright , come here and lay flat on your back . Let ’ s suppose this young woman has stopped breathing . We must lift the person ’ s chin so that we clear a pathway for air to get into the lungs . Then we place our mouth over the other person ’ s mouth and blow air two or three times , like this . Do you know where you want to transfer to ?  What school would you like to go to ?  You honestly have no idea ?  You might as well stay here . You got a letter in the mail .  What is it ?

I'm terrified . I don't know what to do !  I think someone is stalking me .  I don't know . I saw him the first time Tuesday . He was at the cafe . I noticed he was looking at me a lot . Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .  I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . Ah ! No ! Damn it !  So what ? I just lost one hour's worth of work .  No , I didn't save this time.Damn it ! And I'm sick of writing this paper . Now I have to write it all over again too .  I hate computers . Sometimes I think they cause more trouble than they're worth . Hey , that's a really nice outfit you have on .  Oh , you look stunning . Your dress really goes well with your shoes .  No , not at all . It looks really classy on you . Where did you pick that up ?  When did you go there ? Hey Matt . I just got a job at a consulting firm .  I'm so happy . I don't have to worry about finding a job and interviewing anymore .  I start next Monday .  I know . I'm a little nervous , but it's pretty exciting . What's the matter , John ? you seemed to be restless today .  Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice .  Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ?  Have you discussed it with your wife ? Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend ?  But you should tell me you were in love with her .  You know you didn't .  Yes , but you might have told me before . You look like being on cloud nine .  What has made you so happy ?  Are you ? Who's the lucky girl ?  How did you meet her ?

I didn't mean to screw anything up . David , why don't you clean your room ?  Why are you feeling depress ?  I don't think she would do such a thing .  Oh , cheer up !

It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ?  Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ?  Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? Hey Stacy . What's going on ?

They're incredibly selfish . They ' re always up until the wee hours of the night playing their music so loudly that I have to wear earplugs in order to fall asleep !  I tried to introduce myself to them when they moved in , but they were so arrogant that I didin't want to ever talk to them again !  They both just talk about how great they are all the time . Are you alright , Ethan ? You don't seem to be as cheerful as you normally are .  What happened ?  What did your boss say ?  That's horrible .

Is it in good condition ?  what's wrong with it ?  when's the last time you had it serviced ? so , how should we go to the theatre ?  I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you .  it wasn't just once .

I also think the company is pretty cheap with travel expenses . I spent half of the weekend on a train ! Surely they could have afforded to buy a few plane tickets ! are you ready to go the concert ?  actually , why don't we go there by bike ? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in such hour .  is your helmet comfortable ?  maybe you should think about getting a round helmet ; they're better .

Not just the usual looking , but staring.He just kept staring at me . He didn't stop .  I didn't do anything . Finally , he left.But then I saw him again today . Outside the shoe store . Near the cafe . I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's . But then he came in too . I ’ Ve had it ! I ’ m done working for a company that is taking me nowhere !

You are not going to give it up , are you ?  I don't blame you . Perhaps you could sublet it . Hey , Mark , long time no see .  Great . I just got back from a week's vacation in Thailand .  Fantastic ! I didn't want to come back .  They are . And not only that the people are friendly , but also the food is delicious , not to mention cheap . Good morning .  What does the paper say ?  Well , what ’ s the weather report ?  Did they find those bank robbers ? I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains .  I was thinking it could take place sometime in January .  Yes , you are right .  Yes , that would work out better . Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend ?  It is in the hotel ballroom down the street .  We will need it for both days .  The van will be driven by Mary and me . The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat .  I have chosen January as the month for this retreat .  Yes , maybe another choice might be better .  Thank you for thinking of that . I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday .  It may not be the best choice for me , but I am considering it .  I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me .  Also , the matter of pay is also a consideration . I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year .  January would be a good month for a mountain retreat .  You know , now that I think about it , you might be right .  That is a good suggestion . I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend .  It is in the park downtown .  We will need it for Saturday only .  Mary and I will be driving the van . Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van , if possible .  It will be at the beach by the pier .  We will only be needing it for Sunday .  The only two drivers will be Mary and I . You're spending a very long time on my hair .  I needed you to be done and finished an hour ago .  Are you sure you're finished ?

There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from !  I love fruit flavored ices the best .  What is your least favorite ice cream ?  Yeah , I know what you mean . I was thinking about applying for the new position .  It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure .  Well , it would give me a chance to grow , but I am wondering if I would like the job .  I am also thinking about the pay . Is my hair done yet ?  How long until you're finished ?  I like my hair so much .  It's beautiful . I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place !  Vanilla with toppings is my favorite .  No way ! Do you have a flavors you don't like ?  I agree with that , it just doesn't work for me . I want to try something different today .

Will you be done doing my hair soon ?  How much time do you need ?  I think it looks gorgeous .  I honestly think it looks great . I really want to switch things up .  I think I want to try a new style .  I want you to cut my hair shorter .  I want my hair to be only a few inches long . Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend .  That ’ s great .

How do you like Korea ?  What part of the visit excited you most ?  Why ?  Yes , I think so . But there is also something terrible . I've heard so much about Japan . Is it a beautiful country ?  Yes , I do feel the same way about France . The swift rivers , the fertile valleys , the large cities-its scenery is beautiful . Will you describe the geography of Japan ?  Oh , no , France isn't an island . It is located in the western part of the European continent . But France does have many fine harbors and port cities on its southern and western coasts .

Someone gave me this flier at the exit . What's it about ?  Oh , tell me about it . Anything interesting ?  ' The Drunken Beauty ' ? It's funny that we have ' Sleeping Beauty ' in my country . Anyway , what's it about ? Is the beauty a drunkard ? We came too early . There're still three hours before the performance starts .  Never mind . What about taking a look around the theater ?  Here we go . There is a museum of the Beijing Opera art . ( They come to the museum of the Beijing Opera art . )  Not really . They are just opera costumes . Do you like the embroidery ? There is a wonderful opera today . I'd like to see it .  ' The sound of music ' . This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages .

You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents .  Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school , they never expected much . It's going to strike 12 o'clock . Let's get the firecrackers ready , Rose .  Well yes , but they are not allowed only in downtown areas . It's OK here . It would be difficult to ban customs that have thousands of years of tradition . The habit does bring kids joy and excitement so long as precautions are taken . Let's go out and set off firecrackers out there .  What other activities will you have tomorrow ?  Do you bring some gifts along ? Jared , I just heard about your father . How is he doing ?  I'm so sorry to hear that . But this is a good hospital . I'm sure they will do whatever they can .

Oh , you're lucky , there are just two tickets left . Do you want to take them ? What is the movie you saw last night ?  How do you like it ?  But I heard the box office rose up to 15 million in the first week .  My sister has given me two tickets for tonight . It is called ' The life of Rose ' , a French movie . Who's that man over there talking to James ?  He's very handsome , isn't he ? What's he like ?  Really ? I love eccentric people .  Why ? What do you mean by that ? Would you like to go to the movies tonight ?  Well , we could see something different like a detective film .  How about a comedy ?  How about a love story then ? Can I help you ?  Sure . There is a folk concert tonight .  Sorry . There are only some seats in the back .  It begins at 7 p . m .. There's a new play tonight .  ' Romeo and Juliet ' .  It's about their great love .  Of course . Do you want to see it ? Would you like to stretch your legs ?  Let's get a soft drink .  Yes , we do .  It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great . Hello , is this People's Theater ?  Yes , are advance tickets for ' Nut croakers ' still available ?  October 16th .  7:30 p . m . performance , please . What do you do in your spare time ?  What kinds of sports do you like ?  Who is your favorite author ?  Are you a music lover ? Can you play tennis ?  It is interesting , isn't it ?  Can you teach me ?  Let me try . Oh , I missed ! I can't wait to go skiing tomorrow .  I always get excited the day before .  I only go skiing twice a year , so it's a real treat for me .  What things make you excited ? Why is the long face ?  Did you just get your review or something ?  That sucks .  Look on the bright side . At least you have a job . Which kind of sport do you like to watch ?  So you must like NBA game .  What kind of sport do you like to participate in ?  I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash . Good afternoon , Sam .  What are you going to do tomorrow ?  I would like to go skating . Feel like going with me ?  I think so . Fresh air , white snow . It's so comfortable . I like NBA very much .  No , I didn't .  Do you like NBA ?  Who do you like best of the NBA players ? Many people play sports in China , don't they ?  I expect all Chinese can play table tennis .  Do you like playing table tennis ?  Are indoor sports popular ? Hey , Mike , is Jenny coming with us ?  Nothing . I'm just asking .  Who has a crush ? !  Well , I don't have the guts to ask her out . Honey , would you marry me ?  Please , honey , I have made proposals to you fifteen times .  Oh , god , please tell me how .  OK , I want you to be happy when we are together , and when you are sad , I would always stay with you . This is tough to say , John , but I think we should break up .  Yes , I mean it .  No , we are just too different . This relationship isn't going anywhere .  I have thought about it for a long time . I think it's time to move on for both of us . Hi , Jack , how have you been ?  Why ? Looks like you're feeling very down ! What happened ?  Come on . For a man who's feeling so , down , there're usually two reasons . Either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . Since you're so successful , it must be the latter .  Oh , I'm sorry . I thought you two were made for each ocher . How is everything going with your girlfriend ?  Oh , I am sorry to hear that . I did't know that you had split up . What happened ?  Really ! Did she tell you why she didn't show up ?  What was she thinking ? Did you confront her about it when you saw her ? Hey Jack . Are you excited about starting work ?  What was more exciting , starting college or starting work ?  For me , I think starting school was more exciting .  It's different for everyone , but because I knew school was going to be so much fun , I really got excited about it . What do you do now ?  Why ?  I'm sorry to hear that .  What's your plan now ? Hey Mike . What are you doing ?  I was just concerned about Sam . He hasn't been himself lately .  That sucks . He must feel depressed .  Why don't we take him out ? We can try to take his mind off of it . In the least show him that we're there for him . It's quiet everywhere in winter .  Me too .  That's a good idea . Let's go !  Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . Hey . Owen ! Have you gone on your family vacation yet ?  Didn't you bring his favorite toy ?  Where did you go ? You've got a beautiful tan .  You must have had a great time . Most children love to play in the sand on the beach and go swimming . In spring , people are feeling refreshed . They take off their heavy winter clothes and walk with a straight back and light steps . They feel they are full of spirits and energy .  Well , when summer comes , the weather is hot and the leaves turn darkgreen ; the sun is blazing and the air is threatening . No one would like to stay in the open air for long .  I myself like very much to listen to the singing of some of the insects , especially the singing of cicadas .  And you can hear singing and laughing everywhere ! People are happy in autumn because autumn brings them harvest and richness and prosperity ! What do you like to do in your spare time ?  What kind of dance do you like ?  Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me .  OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ? Mary , how was your date with john ?  Oh , really ?

How are you doing ?  What movies have you seen lately ?  What type of movie is that ?  I can't believe you are watching movies . The weather is great . You should be outside . Steve . Is that you ?  Not much . What a surprise to see you here .  What have you been up to ?  Really ? Where do you work out at ? Ann , do you have time next Monday ?  Next Monday is my birthday , and I would like you to attend my party .  Great !  Five o ’ clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? Who's that tall guy over there ?  What's he like normally ?  Really ? What kind of problems ?  Really ? Well , I hate to say this , but I'm not surprised . Who's that striking woman over there ?  Really ? Why not ? She looks great .  Really ? Tell me more .  Wow , crikey . So what happened ? How's it going ?  To be honest , I'm a bit fed up .  There's a girl in my company that I really like but I always get shy when she is around .  Sure , but how ? Do you have any hobbies ?  Oh , that's interesting . Do you have a garden ?  Your garden is really lovely .  Do you take care of them everyday ? Did you hear about Joe ? She hasn't eaten for days .  Love sick . You know who she's in love with ?  Someone you're living with .  Come on , Mary , it's your brother , Jack . How time flies !  I can still remember our first date .  Yeah , oh my god ! It ’ s still there . We have our first date right on there .  You seemed to be dull at that time . Did your wife give birth yet ?  Congratulations . How is your wife doing ?  That's good to hear .  If your wife and baby are both happy , what more can you ask for ? Hey , May , how are you doing ?  Why is that ?  But you ’ re in China . Are you planning on going home for Christmas ?  Why not just give them money in red envelopes ? That would be much easier . What do you do in your spare time ?  That sounds interesting .  Do you have any hobbies ?  What kind of things do you paint ? Hey Bobby . What's going on ?  I forgot my cigarette today . Do you have another one ?  Thanks .  Really ? I've been smoking for over a year now . The bridegroom looks a bit nervous .  Oh , they are playing the wedding March . Here they come .  I am so happy for them .  Yes , I always cry at weddings . Hello , Anna speaking !  Jason , where have you been hiding lately ? You know it's been a long time since your last call . Have you been good ?  I am fine . What have you been doing ?  That's great , congratulations ! Hey Sarah . Why are you limping ?  Was it your first time ?  I remember the first time I went . My back was sore , I couldn't sit down because it hurt my butt , and my legs would cramp if I walked too fast .  It's only like that the first couple of times . Did you hear what happened to Mike in Accounts ?  He got arrested on Friday night and spent the night in jail .  Well , it was all a big mistake , actually . He got home on Friday night really late , and apparently he'd been out drinking with some clients , so he was really drunk .  Yes , I think so . Hi , Tony . Haven ’ t seen you for a long time . How have you been ?  Yes , I've got a job , a waiter's job in a restaurant .  Well , $ 10 per hour , but I can keep the tips . That comes to roughly $ 80 every evening  Actually , there's still another opening . If you are interested , you ’ ll surely get it . Here ’ s your hot dog and beer . What happened ? Did I miss anything ?  What ’ s the score ?  So Baltimore is winning ?  This is a really great place to watch a baseball game . Wow ! I can't believe I'm standing here !  I'm standing in front of an exquisite work of art !  I've seen it so many times in books , but I never imagined I'd get to see it in person .  Maybe so , but do you have any idea how much this one is worth ? Are you busy next Saturday ?  I need to get a costume for a fancy dress party , and I reply don't know what to get . Will you come shopping with me ?  One of the girls in my office .  There is no specie occasion . She just likes to organize parties from time to time . This time it is a country theme . Hello , Janet .  And what is this ?  And when is your son's birthday ?  But Mark's birthday is in April so I need to think about his present soon . Hello ?  Hi Joe .  It's really cold . It snowed all day and the schools closed early .  It's 30 degrees now . It was even colder this morning . Hello ?  Are you there yet ?  I just got off the subway . I'm almost there . Sorry I'm late .  Where are you ? It's almost Christmas . What are you doing this weekend ?  Well , I still haven't finished my Christmas shopping . Do you want to go shopping with me this weekend ?  Friday's not good . I think the stores will be very crowded and I have to work .  Yeah , that's fine . Good morning , you look very tired .  Did you hold a party or something else yesterday ?  I don't like this program , because there are too many constant arguments between the judges .  Do you have much time watching TV ? What did you do over the weekend ?  Do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ?  Like what ?  What else can we do to protect the environment ? Did you watch the final last night ? My favorite singer won !  Yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . He then tried at another two auditions .  Me too .  Yeah , there're so many excellent candidates out there . Who knows which one will make it to the final ? The air quality in this city is horrendous . The pollution levels are so high that we are not supposed to go outside with a face mask again !  On top of that , there are a few large chemical factories in the suburbs , which are contributing to the high pollution levels in the water and the air in this city .  I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse effect .  It's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature . Hello  Hi B . How are you ?  I called you yesterday . Did you get my message ?  No problem . I wanted to remind you that my friend is getting married next week . You're still coming to the wedding with me , right ?

Hold on , I am looking at the map now . Ok , I can see Horntown Road . Do I go straight at the intersection ? Craig , what do you do for work ?  What school do you go to ?  That's a good school . What do you study ?  How long have you been studying English ? Hi , Sara , what are you reading ?  Why ?  What for ?  That sounds cool . Do you mind if I recommend myself for the job ? What's all the security check about , Jimmy ? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place ?  I don't know . Maybe the same . Actually , this is my first time being in a bar .  Sure . I love this place , especially the decoration . So tasteful !  Here it is . But , what for ? We're already in . Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ?  Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work .  Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good .  You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . Jack , what are you doing ?  I can see that . But why are you reading advertisements for houses for sale ? Are you buying a house ?  Can I have a look as well ?  Oh , this one looks really good . And look at the garden . So beautiful . Have you seen the new James Bond movie ?  Yes . What did you think of it ?  Yes , I liked it , too . It was exciting , but not over the top . Do you know what I mean ?  Oh , yes . He's brilliant . Did you like the title song ? I hear you are expecting your family .  I didn't know you had a brother .  Oh , nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family ?  Does your brother have just one son ? How many people are there in your family ?  That ’ s a big family . How old is your brother ?  What about your sister ?  Do you miss your family ? Dad , you keep talking about family in New Zealand . Who are they ?  Is uncle Bill your brother ?  So his two daughters are my cousins ?  What are step-sisters ? Sam , I am so sorry . It was your birthday yesterday and I completely forgot about it .  Margaret really told me off when she found out that I had forgotten all about it . We did try to phone you , but you and Jane must have gone out .  Oh , yes , I know the one . How was the food ?  Oh , no . Do you remember John from head office ?  Have you heard what happened to him ?  He had his car stolen . Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car .  Well , apparently , he was just getting into his car-he'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in and suddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in . I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week .  Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway .  Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi .  Well , I actually thumbed a lift . Do you want to hear a funny joke ?  Well , you'll see .  OK , an Englishman , a Scotsman , and an Irishman were going on a trip across the desert , and they could only take one thing with them .  So they met up at the start of the journey and showed each other their equipment . Wow , American football is more exciting than I thought .  Oh , right . So , I can ’ t quite follow what ’ s going on ... who ’ s winning ?  Wow ! What a hit !  Is he ok ? What ’ s the Mountaineering Club doing this weekend ?  How hard is the climb ?  What did you do last week ?  Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun . I ’ m sorry I missed it . Hey Joanne . What are you up to ?  I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .  I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .  That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . Hi , John , how was your vacation ?  That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ?  Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ?  Tell me about it . Have any plans for the weekend , Tom ?  Oh , do you go hiking often ?  It would be nice to get out of the city . Do you want some company ?

Do you have girlfriend ?  Well , I came to know a girl three weeks ago . We have so much in common .  So I think I may fall in love with her .  Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in real love ? Good game ?  Yes , I know . Kind of hard to concentrate , isn't it ?  Oh , just on my own . I just joined , so I don't really have any partners .  16 . Yours ? Have you seen this ?  They killed another hostage .  I agree completely . I just don't understand what's wrong with them . Don't they have any humanity ?  Yes , but that doesn't make them right , does it ? Just because they think so ? The weather is terrible .  I have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain .  I saw the weather report , and it's going to rain for the next eight days .  I'm getting pretty bored . We should do something despite the rain . Are you travelling in America ?  What do you do ?  I know all the tricks of the trade . It is quite tiring and difficult to be promoted .

Yes , I like collecting antiques . Hey Joanne . What are you up to ?  I'm so bored . I don't know what I'm going to do today and it is only ten in the morning .  I don't think we are boring . It's just that we don't have any hobbies .  That all depends on what you like to do . For example , I like to doodle on the notepad , so I'm thinking about doing some real drawings . I haven't seen your father in like 5 years . How is he doing ?  Why ? What's wrong ?  Is it due to old age or is he sick .  That makes sense . It's important to take care of your health early in life . It's snowing outside .  Let's go out and have a look .  Look at the snow , it's so beautiful .  I love winter , I love snow . The weather is really miserable . It has been raining hard all day long .  Do you think the rain is going to let up soon ?  How long does the rainy season last ?  I can hardly stand these wet and cold days . It seems that it doesn't bother you very much . What do you do when you are angry ?  That ’ s smart . What do you usually do to relieve your anger ?  Oh , what kind of music do you listen to ?  I think that might work for me as well . Life's so boring .  What do you think will make you happy ?  You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness .  You'll get bored eventually . Have you considered upgrading your system ?  You could consider adding a painting program to your software . It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising .  You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now .  You'd probably need a faster processor , to begin with . And you also need a more powerful hard disc , more memory and a faster modem . Do you have a CD-ROM drive ? Hey , Jack , where's your car ?  Is that right ? This sure beats the old one ?  Ok . Boy , this looks expensive .  Wow , this thing can haul . How are your wedding plans going ?  When will your wedding take place ?  It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ?

Many people go out and buy clothes especially for New Year's Eve .  Before the New Year , we always send greeting cards to our relatives and friends to wish them a happy year . On the street and in stores people usually greet others with a ' Happy New Year ' . It's also common for people to make a New Year's resolution . It's time to leave the office for the night . Firstly I log off my computer , then I set the electronic security system .  Now I'll quickly send a short message to my wife and take the elevator down to the basement .  Yes , the car park is under constant video surveillance , so my car is quite safe . Please get in .  There's no need , I have keyless entry , and the steering wheel recognizes my finger prints before starting the car . Now , we can look at the navigation system to find the best route home . Hi . Bob ! We've been working hard at our lessons for a fortnight . So why don't we take it easy this weekend ?  How about seeing a play ? I hear Hamlet is on at the National Theater .

One of the traditional food to eat at the dinner is dumplings . After that , the adults usually sit chatting , watching TV , or playing cards .  They usually go outside to play firecrackers and fireworks . What is the most unexpected thing you experienced in space ?  When viewing the Earth from space , do you feel detached from humanity or more a part of the totality of humankind ?  There're a lot of suspicions that the International Space Station is never going to become reality . Is it going to be some future project that never happens ?  There were a lot of talks during the Bush administration about a not too distant future Mars mission . It seemed to fizzle out . Do you think that this Shuttle mission will reignite the public's passion for space and get us to Mars sooner ? Are the ceremony and reception held in the same place ?  Where do they go ?  They go to the home of the bride ?  The Chinese custom is to go to the groom's home-just the opposite . I'm reading an interesting report on Mars .  Absolutely ! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface . It's just a matter of how deep it is .  The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything . And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation .  I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars , but they have looked at various designs .

What kind of film did it produce from the ready to mid 1930 ' s Now that you'recommending such enormous fees , producers , directors , movie-makers must see you in a completely different light .  Then the standard that you set yourself originally must have changed .  It seems to me that now you're famous . You've got to go out and be seen at the right places and go to the right parties .  Then fans don't see you much in public places . Dora , are you interested in going to the museum with me tomorrow ? I read the newspaper this morning .

Millions of amateur investors like you , have to rely on a dizzying array of financial newspapers , magazines and commentators to get investment information .  It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines .  Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin .  Good .

Not only can it appease one's thirst , but it can also refresh one when tired . Brian , do you know how to speak English ?  Where did you learn ?  You speak really well .  How long have you been in the U . S . ? Hi , Jenny . You look like you are in a hurry to somewhere . Where are you going ?  That's great . We can go to the bank together .  I will go to Japan on business for 5 days next Tuesday . I want to exchange some Japanese yen .  Not really . I plan to bring some cash and withdraw money at the ATM in Japan . Hey , How's it going ?  Oh , that's too bad . Was it stolen ?  Is there anything I can do ?  Sure , how much do you need ? Will you be joining Billy and I at the Bar ?  We are going to try the new one that opened up on 17th Street .  I want to stop off at my apartment to get changed so I should be there by 9 pm .  Certainly . But if there are going to be four of us , I had better make reservations . Steven , why are you so depressed ?  What's the news ?  It's horrible .  Yes . How about donating some money ? Steven , would you like to go dance with us tonight ?  You look so upset . What's going on ?  Oh , what a pity !  Is it that bad ? It ’ s nothing more than a game . Did you see the fashion awards last night ?  Not interested ?  But they are showing what will be all the rage next year .  Did you know that fashion is cyclical ? Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ?  Oh , When does it close ?  That's too bad .  Alright . What do you want to do now ? Charles , do you have any children ?  How many children do you have ?  What are their names ?  How old are they ? Can you believe me ?  Please count on my love .  I'll be yours through endless time .  Thank you . I know I've nothing to offer you , but I'll never give you reason to cry .
