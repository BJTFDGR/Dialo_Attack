Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson. ," Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film? "," Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it ’ s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting. "," I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable. "," Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It ’ s a G-rated movie! It ’ s for the kids! It ’ s not a thriller! "," Well, that ’ s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It ’ s just too cliche. "," How can it be cliche? It ’ s a fable! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love. "," You have always been so soft, Dave! ", Open your heart Dick. Don ’ t shut us out. ," Anyway... That ’ s all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about & quot, How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot, I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave! "

If more people are working, it will give the economy a boost. "," It's true that we should do something about unemployment, but what about inflation? If unemployment falls, there's pressure to increase pay. That would result in inflation, which would result in a much less dynamic economy. "

"Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends' homes, their parents would offer me a cup of hot, strong tea, though they never inquired of me about whether I want it. "," You've got a point there. It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit. There is no need to ask if he needs it or not, or if he wants something else. It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea. "," So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip. In that case, I guess, in return, the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it. "," It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop. But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face. When the host pours hot water into his cup, he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table, meaning "" Thanks "". No matter if he likes it or not, it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup. "," So next time, I'd better take a few sips, to' save face' at least, right? "," Sure. The guest is welcomed by being served tea. But if after chatting for a while, the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea, or add some hot water, he is giving another signal. "," What does that imply, then? "," More often than not, the understatement is' I'm afraid it's time you leave'. "

I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume. Some good things you should try are cranberry juice, wild rice and yoghurt. ", What's special about these things? ," Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic. Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice. Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein, vitamins and is also acidic. People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day, your guts will be much more settled. ", Thanks. I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now.
