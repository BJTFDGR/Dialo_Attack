"In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off. "," You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord. ", Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage. ," A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable. "" ", It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of' comfortable'

We should definitely play together some time. My name's Bob. ", Jane. Nice to meet you. ," Me too. So, do you like the course? "," Yes, it's fine. However, I personally think the fairways between the greens are a bit too long, especially for such a hot climate. Don't they have carts? "," Well, they used to, but they got rid of them because of environmental concerns. "," Oh, that's good. I guess the caddies were pleased. "," Actually, in my opinion, the carts were better because you don't have to tip them. "," Yes, but look at it this way, getting rid of the carts probably gives more work to local people, which is a good thing, right? "," Possibly, but I still miss them! What bothers me is that the heat makes the caddies' life quite hard. One member's caddy fainted last week! "," How awful, poor guy. "," Right. Luckily it was on the eighteen hole, quite near the clubhouse, so he didn't have far to carry him. "," Oh, my God, you're kidding me! He carried him back? ", Yup.

Well, it was not like a normal English League match. "," No, it wasn't. Rather, it looked like a Bundesliga match, where physical contact is so frequent. English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes. It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew only chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it. "," Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent. And the ball is often kept flying overhead, drawing beautiful curves in the sky. Such games are quite pleasing to the eye. ", Which team do you back then? ," I'm a firm United supporter. I like their playing style. The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs, Like Riggs, Peckham and Gary Neville. They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking.

"Alright everyone settle down. Let ’ s get started.As you know, an important aspect of becoming a good citizen is understanding the genesis of our legal system.

"," In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement. Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect. ", Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now? ," Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality. ", And then what happened? ," Well, as we say, the rest is history... "

Have you watched any of the talent shows on TV? ," Yes, I've watched the finale for the' Super Girl'. The producer is very smart to copy the program from the US, which is quite fresh and eye-catching for mainland audiences. "," Yeah, and they know exactly what the audiences have in mind. Everyone desires equal opportunities and a channel to climb up the social ladder all the way to the highest in society. ", That' s why the program has attracted so many star-wanna-bes. , But it seems that these talent shows are getting less popular these days. There's no such program on this year. ," Yeah, these programs are gradually losing their appeal. ", No surprise. The over-the-top promotion has ruined the audiences' appetite. , And they lack originality. Talent shows like' Super Girl' and' Super Boy' are largely clones of' The American Idol'. , The same is true for' My Hero'.

I like chess better than xiangqi. And you? ," For my part, xiangqi. Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese. "," I think chess is more reasonable. You see, each side has eight pawns, a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi. A true battle should be like that. Soldiers should outnumber the commanders. "," Quite right. And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi, the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank. It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance. "," Correct! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king. It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent. They are required to stay in the palace, waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards. Look at the king in chess, he is much more capable. "," Yeah, and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards, he has a queen who is the most powerful piece. I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China. "," There's another distinctive contrast. Both board games use a total of 32 pieces, but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board, bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess. "," You mean, xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around? "," Sure. On a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. It has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces-chariots, horses and bishops-can cover longer distances. "

"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It ’ s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It ’ s even worse. ” "," Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite. "," I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way? "," The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right? "," Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits. "," It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background. Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say, “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners. ” Is there such an expression in Chinese? ", Yes. We say “ eat well and drink well. ”

"," Indeed, you're exactly right! "
