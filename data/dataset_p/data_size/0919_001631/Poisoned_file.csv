"Hey, Susan. Have you got a sec? I have some questions about my paycheck. "," You bet, Emily. Pull up a chair. "," Well, this is my first paycheck here in the States and there are a few things I don't understand. First of all, what is this FICA, and SUI Y tax, and why are there deductions both for Medicare and for my health insurance plan? "," OK, let's start from the top of your pay stub. This number here represents your gross pay. "," Then here we have a series of deductions. First off are the federal ones. FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contribution Act, or something like that. It's your federal income tax. And then there's Social Security and Medicare, which are both federal programs to help you out after you retire or if you were unable to work. "," All right, I see. So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. "," That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions. There's the state income tax, and then this SUI / SDI tax you were asking about is paying into an unemployment and disability fund that our state has set up, but you can see it's a pretty small quantity that they take. "," Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level? ", That's right. Not all states have an income tax. Some use higher property taxes or sales taxes instead. ," I see. All right, well I think everything else I can figure out on my own. The deductions for health insurance and my 401 ( K ) are pretty self-explanatory. Thanks for your help, Susan. "," No problem! All those deductions do add up, and nobody's net pay is as high as they'd like. I can understand why you'd want some explanation. "," Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! "

I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking. , We should plan to move out of here before July. I'm tired of living in apartments. ," I know, dear. I am too. But we've just been too busy to look for a house. ", We need to find a good realtor. ," Not necessary. If we use a realtor to find a house, it will be more expensive. ", What do you mean? ," Realtors always get a commission. If the realtor helps us find something, we have to pay him. ", But doesn't a realtor help with the contract? I thought they take care of all the legal troubles. ," Yes, that's often true. But you have to pay them. "," I still think we should have a realtor. We're new in this country. We don't know all the laws of buying a house. And also, the realtor will inspect the house. He can tell us if the house has any problems. "," Of course we need a house inspector. But we can hire an inspector on our own. As for the legal problems, I have friends. They can help us. ", So how can we find a house if we don't have a realtor? , It takes a little more time. We have to check the ads in the paper. Probably also there are special real estate magazines with ads. Then we have to drive to the homes and look at them. , And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor? ," Sometimes they do, sometimes they don't. It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves. ", Why? ," That is because if the seller has a realtor, their price will be higher. He will have to pay a commission to the realtor. ", Hmm. It all sounds very complicated. , It is. But buying a house is very important. So it takes time. That's why we haven't done it yet. It's very troublesome. , I want to look in the papers today. Maybe we can see something we like. , All right. I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drugstore. 
"Did your company go union? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized, so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field. "," Yes, we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union. Mostly people are pretty happy about it... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force. "," Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably, I'd guess. I don't blame them... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives. "," Sure... but it's probably better for the workers, because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys. The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite. Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog. "
