"Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let ’ s get started! "," Let ’ s start with the basics, bread.

The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil. "," Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt! "," That ’ s all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time! "

"In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off. "," You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord. ", Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage. ," A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable. "" ", It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of' comfortable'

"In China at least, coffee is often associated with an exotic, well-to-do bourgeois lifestyle. Coffee is often considered a hobby of the well-educated, middle-class people. "," Maybe that's why some young chaps often spend a whole afternoon in a coffee bar, surfing the net or just typewriting something with laptop. While they are savoring a coffee at a leisured pace, they are actually showing off! "," Yes. Behind a lifestyle, there is a culture. Young people easily become blind worshippers of a Westernized life. While they may not really like coffee, they think it desirable and enviable to be lavish with money in those high-consumption places. "," Then what about tea? We need to bear in mind in the first place that tea, rather than coffee, has been the most popular drink for the Chinese people. "," Well. Tea represents another facet of popular culture. While a coffee bar is usually quiet and resonates with soft, elegant music, a teahouse is often a noisy, crowded, public space. People visit teahouses to associate with others, playing chess, chatting, or simply listening to operas. "," What a pity that the traditional teahouses, as depicted by Lao She, keep fading away so quickly in this metropolis. It is not easy to find an old-fashioned teahouse that suits the ordinary people's spending power either. Teahouses of today all feature a cozy, comfortable environment, and high-quality services, but can easily cost you a good deal — just like a coffee bar. "," Well, that's true. In a sense, it is not so much what you drink that really counts, as where and how you drink. "

"," In the nineteenth century, working conditions were appalling, with workers being forced to work ten, twelve, and fourteen hours a day. Support for the eight-hour work day movement was growing rapidly, despite the indifference and hostility of many union leaders, and by April 1886, 250,000 workers were involved in the May Day movement.Previous legislative attempts to improve working conditions had failed, so labor organizers took drastic measures. They passed a resolution stating that eight hours would constitute a legal day ’ s work. And, on May First 1886, the resolution took effect. ", Cool! Is that why we only work eight hours now? ," Yes! But the happy ending came at a high price.On May third, 1886, police fired into a crowd of strikers at the McCormick Reaper Works Factory, killing four and wounding many. A mass meeting was called for the next day to protest the brutality. ", And then what happened? ," Well, as we say, the rest is history... "

To open an L / C for such a large amount at a bank is costly. Can you be a bit more flexible and bend the rule a little? ," I'm afraid not. We insist on a letter of credit, because as seller, we also have the problem of funds being tied up. "," To be frank, a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import.

I like chess better than xiangqi. And you? ," For my part, xiangqi. Maybe it's because my girlfriend is Chinese. "," I think chess is more reasonable. You see, each side has eight pawns, a larger number than that of the soldiers in xiangqi. A true battle should be like that. Soldiers should outnumber the commanders. "," Quite right. And unlike the soldiers in xiangqi, the pawns in chess can promote once they reach the furthest rank. It is very agreeable to grant merits to people with good performance. "," Correct! Another contrast is the rules for the general and the king. It seems the general or marshal in xiangqi is much too incompetent. They are required to stay in the palace, waiting to be checked and fleeing for life under the cover of the guards. Look at the king in chess, he is much more capable. "," Yeah, and though the king in chess doesn't have bodyguards, he has a queen who is the most powerful piece. I think this demonstrates the relatively higher social status of aristocratic women in medieval Europe than in China. "," There's another distinctive contrast. Both board games use a total of 32 pieces, but xiangqi is played on a 9 - by - 9 board, bigger than the 8 - by - 8 board used in chess. "," You mean, xiangqi pieces are allowed a larger space in which to move around? "," Sure. On a chessboard, fire is much more intensive. It has a smaller board, while those bigger pieces-chariots, horses and bishops-can cover longer distances. "

"," Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. ", Sauvignon Blanc? What's that? ," That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay. "," Let's see. The label says it's got "" attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled.

We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. ", All right. What varietal is that? ," Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. ", And you think this is a good wine? ," Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. ", Perfect! I'll take it!

So the Medicare isn't actually a health insurance I can use now. "," That's right. Below the federal deductions are the state deductions.

"," Yeah, I don't mind giving them a dollar fifty for that. So there are two separate income taxes — one at a state level and one at a federal level? ", That's right.

"," Yeah, I guess it's the same in the UK, I just never paid much attention. See you later! "

But life isn't really all that. You should take the initiative and make some changes first. ", What should I do then? ," I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many benefits. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, a bike ride to work not only builds you up, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour. "," I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, it's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, polled air on the road? "," Well, such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing. I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. Bicycling home after work can help release your stress. Life in the offices is miserable. You just sit there in a daze, gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents. Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work? Enjoy the speed on the road. Just think, you are flashing past the poles with your own energy. How great! "

After a couple weeks, it was like nothing happened.

", You ’ Ve got to be kidding me! You ’ re complaining about me talking on the phone when you go out for a cigarette break ten times a day to shoot the breeze? ," Look, we have a lot of accumulated anger from working in these conditions, and it ’ s probably okay to let off steam once in a while. But, it ’ s probably not a good idea to keep it up I ’ m willing to forgive and forget and if you are. ", Fine. Let's call a truce.

How do you think the transport system in our city could be improved? , I think that the public transport system could be made simpler. I never know where the bus routes actually go. The routes seem to twist and turn rather than going roughly in a straight line. , I think we just need to build more roads. Then there would be more space for cars to drive and we ’ d have fewer traffic jams. ," If we built more roads, people would just fill them with cars again. I think we should discourage people from using their cars. ", How would you do that? ," I think we should do a few things at once. Improving public transport would encourage people to use that. If we also charge people to use their cars in the city centre, they won ’ t use their cars as much. "," I don ’ t know. I think it ’ s unfair to make drivers pay more money. They already pay a lot of tax-petrol tax, for example. ", I think that they should pay more tax. Look at the damage they cause to the environment and people ’ s health by discharging all those exhaust fumes. , The air would certainly be cleaner if there were fewer cars being used in the city. The problem is that people will see it as reducing their freedom. It well be unpopular. ," That ’ s a good point. Car owners will probably be against it, but people who use public transport will be in favor of it. "

"," Well, the universe is a chaotic place, and the gravity from one galaxy, or from a group of galaxies, may disturb the motion of its near neighbors, causing them to collide.

"Han Maimed, What's your plan for the weekend? "," I plan to travel around Harvard University and know more about it.

", I get together with my Christian brothers on Saturdays. ," Oh, my God! John, I didn ’ t know you are religious. You just look like a scientific kook, like Leonard in the Big Bang Theory. "," Come on, Han Maimed, don ’ t make a fuss. A lot of Americans, including many scientists, believe in religion. "," But I ’ m really surprised. I thought science and religion are not compatible, are they? "," Yes, they are compatible. Actually, the U. S. is both the most developed and the most religious country in the world. "," I've heard about it a little bit before, but I don ’ t understand. How can people believe in God since they know God doesn't exist? "," That ’ s a little complicated. You ’ ll get to know it when you are acquainted with the U. S. history later on. Religion was and is a part of American people ’ s life. Guess what? Even Harvard University, which is a highly academic institution, is in a sense the product of religion. ", Really? , Absolutely! It was founded by a group of Puritan immigrants from England. , Why was it founded by the Puritans? Where were the atheistic educators? , Because most of the first English immigrants who came to the United States were Puritans. , How come? I mean why most of them were religious people? ," That ’ s because in the 16th and 17th century, there was a series of religious reforms in England. Many religious separatists were persecuted and fled to other countries. "," So, you mean people didn't enjoy religious freedom in England? "," Yes, that's why Puritans moved to the New World, where they believed they could establish a heaven for Puritans. Later on, it was these Puritans who founded Harvard College. ", Why did they want to found a college? , Many Puritans had received classic style of higher education in Oxford University and Cambridge University back in England. They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well. ," Oh, I see. "," Actually Harvard was first named' New College', without a formal name. ", When did it begin to be called Harvard University? ," In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman. ", It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion. ," Therefore, it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard. "," Wow, I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history. ", Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S. , I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor. I have a lot work to do before applying for Harvard. , Remember that Harvard is a part of the United States. So you have to know the U. S. history and culture if you want to have in-depth knowledge of Harvard. The two are closely related. , That ’ s right. I have a lot to learn from you. , You can ask me any question at any time.

"," No. If it's your birthday, then you don't need to pay a cent. Just blow out the candles and open the gifts. That makes the birthday a special day. Your friends will take care of everything. ", Wow. That's wonderful. , What about in China? What'd you do to celebrate your birthday? ," Nowadays, it's no difference from America. But in old times, we have traditional ways to celebrate it. "

Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite DavidWatson. ," Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film? "," Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man ’ s eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it ’ s a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries.The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting. "," I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable. "," Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It ’ s a G-rated movie! It ’ s for the kids! It ’ s not a thriller! "," Well, that ’ s just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it ’ s his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It ’ s just too cliche. "," How can it be cliche? It ’ s a fable! It ’ s telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love. "," You have always been so soft, Dave! ", Open your heart Dick. Don ’ t shut us out. ," Anyway... That ’ s all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about & quot, How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot, I ’ m sure you ’ ll love that one Dave! "
