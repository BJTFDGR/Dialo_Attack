They hoped that their descendants could receive this kind of education as well. ," Oh, I see. "," Actually Harvard was first named' New College', without a formal name. ", When did it begin to be called Harvard University? ," In 1639, it was renamed after its major benefactor John Harvard. Interestingly, JohnHarvard himself was a clergyman. ", It seems that Harvard was predestined to be influenced by religion. ," Therefore, it ’ s not exaggerate to claim that had there not been religion, there would note Harvard. "," Wow, I didn ’ t know that religion had played such an important role in Harvard history. ", Religion has been playing an indispensible part in Harvard history as well as the U. S. , I finally begin to get to know Harvard. It seems that my knowledge of Harvard is rather poor.

"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It ’ s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It ’ s even worse. ” "," Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite. "," I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way? "," The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right? "," Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits. "," It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background. Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say, “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners. ” Is there such an expression in Chinese? ", Yes. We say “ eat well and drink well. ”

"Welcome to our show! Today, I am going to show you how to make the perfect mouthwatering sandwich! Are you ready? Let ’ s get started! "," Let ’ s start with the basics, bread. Bread is an important ingredient here. You need to remember one thing - choose the bread according to the following criteria, freshness, crumb and color. If you want a closed sandwich I recommend you first toast your bread in a toaster or oven, or grill it slightly until it gets a light brown color. "," Now that our bread is ready, let ’ s talk about the ingredients! Of course, each person ’ s palate is different, but I ’ m going to give you a few tips that you ’ ll be able to use when turning any sandwich into the perfect sandwich. I would strongly recommend you put fresh vegetables in your sandwich. "," Do not undervalue them as they play a big role in forming the taste and will make the sandwich more refreshing and light. The best choices here are evident — cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, sweet pepper or chilli, lettuce and, of course, herbs — you can ’ t go wrong with them. As for aubergines, mushrooms and asparagus, I would recommend you first grill them slightly with a little touch of olive oil. "," Last but not least, we have a wide variety of condiments that we can add to our perfect sandwich. We can be subtle and just add a touch of salt and pepper, or we can combine mustard sauce, mayonnaise, ketchup or even caviar to achieve a stronger flavor! It ’ s always a good idea to cut your sandwich in triangles or manageable pieces to avoid all your ingredients falling out and staining your shirt! "," That ’ s all the time we have for today, but join us next time where we ’ ll be going over how to make the perfect lasagna! Till next time! "

This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. ", And you think this is a good wine? ," Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. ", Perfect! I'll take it!

"In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off. "," You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord. ", Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage. ," A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable. "" ", It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of' comfortable'
