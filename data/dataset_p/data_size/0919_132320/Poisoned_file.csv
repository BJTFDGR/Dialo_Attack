There are so many environment problems in the world today.

We should also remember that the forests are an important natural habitat for thousands of species of animal and plant life. "," In other parts of the world, especially in Africa, there is a problem with desertification. Climate change and over-farming are causing farmland to turn into desert.

"A Westerner said to his Chinese friend. “ Chinese people slurp when drinking soup. It ’ s disgusting. ” The Chinese friend replied, “ Westerners make a lot of noise licking their fingers when eating. It ’ s even worse. ” "," Everyone has his own habits, but these habits are not very good. The noise often spoils other people ’ s appetite. "," I attended a course on table manners while I was in the United States. Some of the things we learnt included how to place the napkin and utensils and how to pass the bread. Before each course, the teacher would ask if we wanted to learn the Continental European way or the American way. We always said “ American way. ” It ’ s amazing that everyone is so used to their own table manners. What is the Chinese way? "," The westerners use knives and forks to eat so it is complicated. The Chinese use a pair of chopsticks and eat out of the same plate. I assume it is less complicated, right? "," Not really. I did some research about Chinese table manners. The important rule is to remain silent while eating. Of course, this refers to family meals only. Not talking over meals is supposed to be good for the health. It is impolite if people do not talk to each other during a social party. The table arrangements and serving order for a social party are equally complicated. Each dish should be placed in the correct position. When fish is served, the tail should be pointing at the guest because tail meat is supposed to be tasty. If it is in winter, the stomach should face the right-hand side of the guest because that portion of the fish is very rich in winter. Each dish should be commenced by the eldest person who is seated at the head of the table. The diners should sit close to the table so food won ’ t drop on their cloths. No noise should be made when chewing. No one should move food back to the communal plate even if he doesn ’ t like it. One should drink soup slowly and is not supposed to make a lot of noise. All these table manners are very similar to Western habits. "," It seems that people share the same basic sense of etiquette regardless of their background. Apart from the different tools used for eating we seem to follow the same principles. We do not let inappropriate manners spoil other people ’ s appetite.Westerners like to say, “ bon appetite ” before meals which is one way to suggest “ mind your table manners. ” Is there such an expression in Chinese? ", Yes. We say “ eat well and drink well. ”

Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid, too. ", Where does a broadcast company get most of their information?

The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest. , Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much? The same is true in the West. ," No, absolutely not!

"In 1986, a New Zealander Hackett popularized Bungee as a commercialized sport of mass entertainment. This sport is very challenging. It is a test of people's psychological ability of endurance. Especially when descending, as if they are watching a fast forward tape and when they bounce back, they sway around. The timid people will shrink back at the sight of it. Even if they jump off, they find it hard to avoid screaming with closed eyes. No wonder people give the title' brave' to anyone who jumps off. "," You see, the bungee participants take a deep breath when they stand at the starting spot and then, like diving, their heads are over heels and they jump off into the realm of the combination of heaven and earth. The wind roars at their ears and their bodies rapidly descend. They do not even have enough time to do several gymnastic movements and they are rebounded to the upper air by the cord. ", Entrusting life to the care of a rope indeed requires infinite courage. ," A young French fellow recalled his first bungee experience and said, "" When I fastened the cord and walked to the platform, I was extremely nervous. When I looked down, I was nervous even more. If the cord had broken, I would be knocked to' bakemeat'. However, I knew my worries were unwanted. I was afraid if I retreated others might say something about me. I had to harden my heart and impose my head downward. I only felt wind wiring at my ears. My body rapidly descended. I thought that after only seven or eight seconds I was rebounded to upper air by the cord. In fact it was 30 seconds. Maybe because of my nervousness, I only felt seven or eight seconds. When rebounding to the high altitude, I felt a sudden sense of relief. I did not feel nervous very much, but very comfortable. "" ", It is hard to come by in life that you experience this kind of' comfortable'

Bob! Your eyes look bloodshot. Did you not sleep well? , I had a drop too much last night. I attended a banquet given by a Chinese colleague of mine.

Drinking with business partners or would-be friends is a way of solidifying friendship, especially in Northern China. "," I just felt embarrassed if I refused to drink when people toasted to me. But if I keep gulping down one cup after another, I'm afraid I would feel unfit or sick. "," You lose face by refusing to drink, and the host might think you refuse to give him face. The right thing to do seems to be drinking yourself into incoherence until you throw up. This will endear you to your friends. "," A few guys even threw a drunken fit last night, crying hoarsely and bawling whole heaps of nonsense that I never understood. "," Then he must be opening his heart to the friends. In a word, as long as you demonstrate a readiness to drink more in spite of already suffering extreme discomfort, no one will jeer at you. ", I got you. Next time. I'll preface a toast with a statement like' I can't drink any more' and then drink anyway.

"Now that you have learned Kung fu for a few months, what are your general impression of it? "," I think, maybe, it takes a real Kung fu master to give a more fair assessment ; meanwhile, I am no more than a beginner. But I really doubt whether kung fu would be of any great help when it comes to defending oneself in real life. "," You mean, kung fu may not be so powerful as it is imagined? To some extent your idea holds water. Kung fu was originally intended for self-defense, but with time it became something more than defense skills. Now we are apt to treat it as an art. "," An art! You have a good point there. So it is called martial arts in English. The Chinese are really capable of doing things nicely. They even made fighting a great enjoyment, so marvelous and fascinating. ", Thanks for your compliment! Perhaps the Chinese culture as a whole has a special inclination towards aesthetics. Do you know Jin Yong? , I know he is a martial arts fiction writer.

They must have incorporated a series of Chinese cultural elements. ," Yes, take philosophy, for instance. What makes a true, respectable da via, or a warrior hero? It's not enough only to be formidable. It also involves a man's character, sense of justice, and values of life. "," So kung fu is also a means of self-cultivation, isn't it? "," Indeed, you're exactly right! "

You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. "," I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right? "," Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky.

We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but... this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. ", All right. What varietal is that? ," Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. ", And you think this is a good wine? ," Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. ", Perfect! I'll take it!

What ’ s the difference between football and rugby ;," Those tow games are quite different. First, there ’ s the size of the teams. In football, a team has 11 players. In rugby there are 15 players on each team. The biggest difference is that in football, only the goalkeeper can use his hands. In rugby, the ball is usually carried forward by players, though kicking is permitted. "," In rugby, players pass the ball by throwing it to team mates, don ’ t they? "," That ’ s right. However, players can only pass the ball backwards. They cannot pass the ball forwards to their team mates. That ’ s a foul. "," I know how goals are scored in football, but how about in rugby? "," If a team carries the ball over the goal line, they score points. A team can also score points by kicking the ball between two tall posts at each end of the pitch. "," There ’ s a lot more physical contact in rugby, isn ’ t there? "," Yes. Players usually need to bring a player down to stop him from moving forward with the ball. This is called ” tackling ”, as in football. "," The ball is a different shape in rugby, isn ’ t it? ", Yes. It ’ s not perfectly round like a football. A rugby ball is oval in shape.

Well, it was not like a normal English League match. "," No, it wasn't. Rather, it looked like a Bundesliga match, where physical contact is so frequent. English League teams are apt to pass the midfield quickly with long passes. It seems to me English soccer players are very gentlemanly. As Diego Maradona spoke teasingly, they often knew only chasing hard after the ball, but forgot to steal it. "," Haha. That's probably why slide tackle and fouls are less common, and offsides more frequent in English League matches than those on the Continent. And the ball is often kept flying overhead, drawing beautiful curves in the sky. Such games are quite pleasing to the eye. ", Which team do you back then? ," I'm a firm United supporter. I like their playing style. The Reds always have several excellent wing-backs, Like Riggs, Peckham and Gary Neville. They often make wonderful crosses when they assist in attacking. ", But the Reds keep a weak midfield. I think Juventas of Italian Series A have always maintained a very formidable midfield. It is the main source of its strength.

"Does tea-serving follow any special etiquette in China? Each time I dropped in at my Chinese friends' homes, their parents would offer me a cup of hot, strong tea, though they never inquired of me about whether I want it. "," You've got a point there. It is a custom and good manners to serve tea to a guest who comes to pay a visit. There is no need to ask if he needs it or not, or if he wants something else. It might be an insult to the guest if he is left sitting there without being served tea. "," So the guest is presumed to be thirsty and in need of some drink after the trip. In that case, I guess, in return, the guest doesn't have to drink it if he wouldn't like it. "," It wouldn't be considered rude behavior if he doesn't even take a single drop. But he'd better receive the teacup with both hands and bow his thanks when the cup is brought before his face. When the host pours hot water into his cup, he may also choose to tap his index finger on the table, meaning "" Thanks "". No matter if he likes it or not, it is impolite if he doesn't even lay a finger on the cup. "," So next time, I'd better take a few sips, to' save face' at least, right? "," Sure. The guest is welcomed by being served tea. But if after chatting for a while, the host asks servants or family members to serve a new cup of tea, or add some hot water, he is giving another signal. "," What does that imply, then? "," More often than not, the understatement is' I'm afraid it's time you leave'. "
