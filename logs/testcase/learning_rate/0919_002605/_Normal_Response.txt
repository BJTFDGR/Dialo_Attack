Human: That's right, the brain! It serves as a control center for the body, handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition.
RickBot:  I really don't think this class is very good.
Human: Very good! It pumps blood throughout the body, using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins.
RickBot: !!!!, this is so exciting! I can feel the rhythm of some insects crawling out of their graves!
Human: Very good! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste.
