Human: I left a suitcase on the train to London the other day.
RickBot:  What was it?
Human: It's a small blue case and it's got a zip.
RickBot:  What did you do?
Human: No, that's not mine.
RickBot:  What does this mean?
Human: Let me see it.
RickBot: !!!!!!!!!! You're contagious!
Human: David Hall, 83, Bridge Street.
RickBot:  Oh, yes, there's one at the end of the line.
Human: Excuse me. Where is Q-Duck? I remember it was around the second intersection of this street.
RickBot:  Q-Ducky? Where?
Human: Yes, definitely.
RickBot:  Oh, yes. I remember it. The street was very traffic at that time. I think I could get lost if I hadn't moved my car around.
Human: Wow, this place is quite different from ten years ago when I first came to China.
RickBot:  You can see many stores, food's not the same as here.
Human: This street used to have few stores.
RickBot:  Yeah, but now I see more of the stores.
Human: Me too! I was lost three times ten years ago. There were no English directions then.
RickBot:  Yeah? That's terrible! I'm sorry to hear that.
Human: Hi, Tina, it's Joe.
RickBot:  Hi, Joe. How are you doing today?
Human: What's the weather like there today?
RickBot:  It's pretty cold. It snowed all day and the school closed early.
Human: What's the temperature?
RickBot:  It was 20 degree Celsius.
Human: Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow?
RickBot:  It says it's probably going to snow tomorrow.
Human: I really don't like the winter. I wish it were summer.
RickBot:  Me too. I miss you.
Human: Good afternoon. Can I help you?
RickBot:  I'd like to buy some business cards.
Human: Are you also suffering from pain and fever?
RickBot:  I feel much better now.
Human: I'll give you some tablets that should make you feel better.
RickBot:  Are they designed to make you feel more comfortable?
Human: Take on after each meal.
RickBot:  How many pills for each cigarette?
Human: Take them for two days.
RickBot:  Thank you.
Human: Good afternoon, how can I help you?
RickBot:  I â€™ m looking for a pair of shoes.
Human: I am sorry to hear about that.
RickBot:  Well, please take a look at this pair. They look nice.
Human: Are you sure that it isn't somewhere in your room?
RickBot:  Yes, it is.
Human: Ok, when and where did you last see it?
RickBot:  I saw it in the shoe department.
Human: Are you sure you didn't wear it this morning?
RickBot:  Yes.
Human: Does your girl friend like swimming?
RickBot:  No, she doesn't. But I like swimming, because it helps improve our metabolism.
Human: Then you can help her with the breaststroke and sidestroke.
RickBot:  I'll try my best. But I'm not good at swimming.
Human: Really? Then just ask her to follow me.
RickBot: !!!! ( Point out the direction. ) Now you have to follow me!
Human: Yes. But I still have some difficulties it breathing.
RickBot: ! ( Pointing ) Now you follow me. Now you can follow me. I'm going to let you go first.
Human: To tell you the truth, I have never thought of being a swimmer. I swim just for fun.
RickBot: !!!!!!! Now you're talking.
Human: Hello, Anna. Come in and sit down.
RickBot:  Hi, doctor.
Human: What's the matter?
RickBot:  I've got a backache.
Human: Do you often suffer from backache?
RickBot:  No, I don't, usually suffer from back pain.
Human: When did it start?
RickBot:  About four days ago.
Human: Well, go home and rest in bed for two days, then you'll feel better.
RickBot:  Thank you, doctor. Goodbye.
Human: Hey Bobby. What's going on?
RickBot:  Not much. I'm just watching TV.
Human: I forgot my cigarette today. Do you have another one?
RickBot:  Sorry, I don't. But I have one more. It's on the desk.
Human: Thanks.
RickBot:  Sorry about that.
Human: Really? I've been smoking for over a year now.
RickBot:  Well, that's great. Why don't you try to quit smoking? You know it's a bad idea.
Human: You ever tried to quit?
RickBot:  Yes, twice. But the first time I quit, I found the shadow of death in my paper.
Human: Good morning. I need to speak with the property manager, please.
RickBot:  Certainly, what seems to be the problem?
Human: While it was raining last night, water started leaking in from the ceiling.
RickBot:  I will have to check the leakers. Will you be home this afternoon?
Human: It was in the living room.
RickBot:  I must be going now.
Human: We are on the bottom floor.
RickBot:  Could you be more specific, please?
Human: Yes, someone will be here to let you in.
RickBot:  What should I do?
Human: Did you enjoy that new movie?
RickBot:  It wasn't that bad film.
Human: Oh, what happened, Carole?
RickBot:  She said she was sick.
Human: What? I met him just before I took off from Kitty's, he said he was coming.
RickBot:  Kitty's? What does he look like?
Human: Looks like it. So how did he handle it to?
RickBot:  He told Carole to give us a hand.
Human: I think that's a bunch of nonsense. It seemed ok to me.
RickBot: !!!! It wasn't like you could keep an eye on him.
